# A classic game of hangman made with pure Ruby

# How to play

Clone the code to a directory and run the file from that directory
in the terminal by typing 'ruby main.rb'
(Only works if Ruby is already installed on your computer).

Try to guess the hidden word by typing in one letter at a time when prompted.
If you fail, you die!!  >:)

Type 'save' into the prompt to save your current progress.
Type 'quit' to exit the game early.
